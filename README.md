# ICML 2024 Session Finder. 
Welcome to the ICML 2024 Session Finder! This tool helps you search for sessions and ask questions about them using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. The selected sessions include the session name, authors, time, location, and abstract, which are added to the language model's prompt.  

## Just get me to the tool
Access the [ICML Session Finder here: Link](https://lukasmosser--icml-finder-run.modal.run/)

## Features 
- Session Search: Search for ICML sessions using natural language queries.
- Selected Sessions: Add sessions to your list of selected sessions.
- Session Chat: Ask questions about your selected sessions and receive AI-generated responses.

## How to Use
1. Set a Good Window Height: Adjust the chat window height in the sidebar.
2. Ask Questions: Ask any questions about all the sessions to find relevant content.
3. Utilize the Language Model: Request the language model to perform tasks on the selected sessions, such as "Make me a schedule for these" or "Tell me what these have in common."
4. Enjoy ICML!

## Why?!
I participated in the [AI Makerspace Cohort 1](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/LLM-Ops-Cohort-1) which gave me 1000s of dollars of free credits for all kinds of services including [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/)  and [OpenAI](https://openai.com) and I wanted to put them to good use and make something practical.
